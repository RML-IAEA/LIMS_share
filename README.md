# Senaite LIMs Share
## IAEA RML laboratory 
The RML laboratory of the IAEA are currently adapting Senaite LIMS to their laboratory and wish to make their developments and information available to all radiation monitoring environmental laboratories. The RML laboratory currently use 3 GITHUB repositories to support our LIMS developments. 

1)	LIMS_share - Public repository (this repository) which is used to assist laboratories that are engaged with the ALMERA Network and other scientific/environmental laboratories.
2)	https://github.com/ridingbytes/iaea.lims - Private repository which is used to exchange developments with our enterprise solutions partner RidingBytes. This repository includes a Senaite add-on called iaea.lims which can be made available to other laboratories once complete. 
3)	https://github.com/LimsIAEA/LIMS_dev - Private repository which is used to manage our LIMS developments at the IAEA RML Laboratories.

We wish to share all information with other laboratories via the "LIMS_share" Github repository.
