** Recommendation
  To assist with the management of Senaite Lims we find it best to establish three environments. These environments are: 
  - Development Environment - Uses Docker to quickly build the latest versions of Senaite and test changes made Senaite core or addon packages.  
  - Staging Environment - An environment which is used to test any changes on a system that mimics the production environment.
  - Production Environment - The environment that is live. 

  

To get started with Senaite in a docker container please see our [guide](https://github.com/LimsIAEA/LIMS_share/tree/main/docker)
To get started with Senaite in a staging or production environment please see our [guide](https://github.com/RML-IAEA/LIMS_share/blob/main/InstallGuideProduction/SLE-12-SP5/SENAITE-SLES-VM.org)
