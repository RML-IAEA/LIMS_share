# I 129 Analysis.
## Introduction
As part of the first inter-laboratory comparison (ILC) of water samples treated with the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS), I-129 was analysed by High Purity Germanium (HPGe) gamma spectrometry. The chemical composition of the water after the ALPS treatment was unknown. The HPGe was calibrated with an I-129 a traceable standard obtained from X and prepared with a chemical composition the same as the standard. Since the chemical composition of the water after the ALPS treatment was unknown and that the photon emissions of I-129 occur at energies less than 39.578 keV it is required to quantify the degree of attenuation that occurs in the samples as these low energy photons transverse the matrix to the detector. The degree of attenuation in a sample can be calculated and introduced as a correction factor, known as the self-attenuation correction factor, when quantifying the activity of a sample at a given energy. To evaluate self-attenuation the linear attenuation coefficient for the material at the photon energy of interest must be known. This can be experimentally determined or if the contribution by mass percentage of each chemical is known, the linear attenuation coefficient can be calculated with XCOM
## Method
I-129 includes low energy photon emissions, table x, with energies that are less than the resolution of most HPGe detector configurations.  Emissions of similar energy were combined to produce an average energy, table x.

### Determination of Linear Attenuation Coefficient for ALPS Sample
Sample 220217 was used for the experiment. Due to the low activity of the point source of I-129, only the combined lines of 29.459 and 29.779 were used.
From the evaluation of the linear attenuation, an upper and lower estimate of the linear attenuation coefficient of the matrix was established.

X HPGe detectors were used for the analysis of I-129. Three different geometries were used, namely 805010, WELLGEO and 500ml Marinelli. 

Many programs for the computation of self-attenuation corrections requires that the matrix is defined in terms of the elemental composition. XCOM was used to define a simplified matrix composition which when used produced a linear attenuation coefficients that matched the experimentally determined linear attenuation coefficients. An upper and lower simplified matrix was determined. The simplified matrix composition upper estimate (0.492505887cm<sup>-1</sup> @ 29.619 keV) is composed of;
  
| Element | Fraction    |
|---------|-------------|
| H2O     | 0.996450643 |
| Pb      | 0.003549357 |
  
The simplified matrix composition lower estimate (0.364947076 cm<sup>-1</sup> @ 29.619 keV) is composed of;
| Element | Fraction |
|---------|----------|
| H2O     | 0.77       |
| C       | 0.13       |

NOTE ‚òù: Longer count times or stronger point sources will increase the net counts and reduce the uncertainty associated with the evaluation of the linear attenuation coefficient. 

For EFFTRAN and LABSOCS the upper and lower estimates of the matrix composition was used to calculate the self attenuation correction factor. For GESPECOR both the
