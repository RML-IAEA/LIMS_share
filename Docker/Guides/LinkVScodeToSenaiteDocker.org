* Synopsis
You can downlaod all files of the LIMS_share github [[https://github.com/RML-IAEA/LIMS_share/archive/refs/heads/main.zip][here]].

This directory contains a Docker development configuration (~develop-compose.yml~) and a Docker Cluster setup configuration (~docker-compose.yml~) for SENAITE LIMS. The Docker development configuration(~develop-compose.yml~) and Docker Cluster setup configuration (~docker-compose.yml~) are independent of one another (i.e. only one is required to setup Senaite).  The Docker development (~develop-compose.yml~) configuration reduces the number of SENAITE instance to one which saves times when reloading Senaite during development. The Cluster setup configuration mimics the system that should be setup for your production environment. It is advised not to run your production (or live) version of Senaite from a Docker container and instead install Docker on a server (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE, etc.).

The Cluster setup starts the following services:
+ NGINX web server, serving HTTPS on port 8000
+ HAProxy load balancer, running on port 8888
+ 2 SENAITE instances, running on port 8081 and 8082
+ 1 ZEO Database Server

For Windows Users the database can be stored locally (i.e. on the windows system) using a volume bind. See the volume listing in the develop-compose and docker-compose.yml files. The text below is a snippet from the file.  Update the path 'C:\DockerLimsEnvFiles\senaite\data' to a location where you would like to store your Senaite data. Ensure to create the data folder on your Windows machine. 
#+begin_src sh
volumes:
  senaite_vol:  
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: 'none'
      o: 'bind'
      device: 'C:\DockerLimsEnvFiles\senaite\data'
#+end_src

* SENAITE Docker Versions

The SENAITE Docker image used in this setup is version ~2.x~ from here:
https://hub.docker.com/r/senaite/senaite/tags

This image is automatically built from the official ~senaite.core~ GitHub repository:
https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core/actions/workflows/docker.yml

NOTE ☝: This Docker image contains the latest code and should not be used for
        production environments!


* To download or update to the latest SENAITE 2.x image:
In PowerShell or Command Prompt, run;
  #+begin_src sh
  docker pull senaite/senaite:2.x
  #+end_src

* Start a Cluster instance using Cluster setup configuration
In Powershell or Command Prompt, run;
+ Change your directory to the path where the ~docker-compose.yml~ is located, example:
  #+begin_src sh
  cd C:\Users\nael-lab\Documents\GitHub\iaea.lims\docker
  #+end_src

NOTE ☝: Your path will be diffrent. Update the path to the folder where you have placed your docker-compose.yml file!

+ Start the instance 
  #+begin_src sh
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
  #+end_src

Once complete, access Senaite via your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080

* Start a development instance using development configuration
In Powershell or Command Prompt, run;
+ Change your directory to the path where the ~develop-compose.yml~ is located, example:
  #+begin_src sh
  cd C:\Users\nael-lab\Documents\GitHub\iaea.lims\docker
  #+end_src

NOTE ☝: Your path will be different. Update the path to the folder where you have placed your develop-compose.yml file!

+ Start the instance 
  #+begin_src sh
  docker-compose -f develop-compose.yml up
  #+end_src

Once complete, access Senaite via your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080

* Start the development instance in foreground mode:
If you would like to get started with developing in Senaite and need a way to reload your code changes without restarting Docker you can use @@reload. To do so, 
modify your develop-compose.yml so that Senaite starts in foreground mode. You need to include the 'fg' command as shown;

  #+begin_src sh
	version: "3.9"

	services:

	  instance:
		container_name: instance
		image: senaite/senaite:2.x
		restart: "unless-stopped"
		command: fg
		ports:
		  - "8080:8080"
		deploy:
		  resources:
			limits:
			  memory: 4GB
		environment:   
		  ADDONS: "senaite.databox plone.reload"
		  SOURCES: "senaite.databox=git https://github.com/senaite/senaite.databox.git branch=master"
		
		volumes:
		  # we need to be selective here, because build files with symlinks, e.g. parts/omelette, cause problems.
		  - senaite_vol:/data/.


	volumes:
	  senaite_vol:
		driver: local
		driver_opts:
		  type: 'none'
		  o: 'bind'
		  device: 'C:\DockerLimsEnvFiles\senaite\data'

  #+end_src
To determine if you have successfully launched Senaite in foreground mode, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/senaite/@@overview-controlpanel. The botton of the page will state that 'you are running "debug mode"'. See; 
[[https://github.com/LimsIAEA/LIMS_share/blob/main/docker/Screenshots/DebugMode.PNG]]

The reload feature is accessed from http://127.0.0.1:8080//@@reload. 

NOTE ☝: Not all features can be reloaded using this feature and in some situations you might need to restart your container to reload!
